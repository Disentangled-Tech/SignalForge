## Variant A — Clear and Direct

Hi {founder_name},

I work with founders who are entering a scaling phase where systems and delivery complexity start demanding stronger technical leadership.

In those moments, a short-term strategic partner can prevent expensive rework and reduce internal friction.

If you’re open to it, I’d be glad to discuss how that might look in your context.

If now isn’t right, completely understand.

Best,  
Tricia
