## Variant A — Short

Hi {founder_name},

When teams start accelerating, the underlying systems often need a bit more intentional structure.

I’ve put together a short {value_asset} that helps founders reduce technical chaos before it compounds.

If you’d like it, I’m happy to share.

No pressure at all — just offering in case it’s helpful.

Best,  
{your_name}

## Variant B — Medium

Hi {founder_name},

I spend a lot of time with early-stage teams navigating growth while trying to avoid accidental technical debt.

There’s usually a moment when product momentum and delivery pace outgrow the original architecture — and it helps to pause and simplify.

I’ve created a brief {value_asset} founders use to clarify what’s stable vs. what needs attention.

Would it help if I sent that over?

If not, completely understand — just wanted to extend the offer.
