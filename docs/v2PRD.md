SignalForge v2 — Updated PRD

Inflection Intelligence Engine (Neurodivergent-Aware)

⸻

1. Executive Summary

SignalForge v2 identifies companies entering technical inflection points while safeguarding founder autonomy, cognitive safety, and ethical outreach.

The system does not optimize for urgency or extraction.

It optimizes for:
	•	Timing precision
	•	Energy sensitivity
	•	Alignment with underserved founders
	•	Sustainable deal flow

⸻

2. Core Architectural Shift

Instead of a single readiness score, v2 introduces:

A. Technical Readiness Score (TRS)

Measures likelihood of technical inflection in next 30–120 days.

Dimensions:
	•	Momentum
	•	Complexity
	•	Pressure
	•	Leadership Gap

This identifies need.

⸻

B. Engagement Suitability Layer (ESL)

Evaluates whether engagement at this moment is appropriate and how it should be framed.

This protects:
	•	Neurodivergent founders
	•	Burnout-prone founders
	•	Your energy
	•	Ethical boundaries

⸻

C. Outreach Recommendation Layer

Outreach Score = TRS × ESL × Alignment Factor

Outputs:
	•	Observe Only
	•	Soft Value Share
	•	Low-Pressure Introduction
	•	Standard Outreach
	•	Direct Strategic Outreach

⸻

3. Target User (Updated)

Primary:
	•	Fractional CTO serving neurodivergent and early-stage founders

Secondary:
	•	Ethical operators
	•	Community-focused advisors

⸻

4. Updated System Architecture

Layer 1 — Signal Ingestion

Funding, hiring, product, compliance, launch signals.

Layer 2 — Technical Readiness Engine

Deterministic scoring with time decay.

Layer 3 — Engagement Suitability Layer (NEW)

Stress-aware dampening + autonomy protection.

Layer 4 — Alignment Layer

Manual and semi-structured filters:
	•	Founder mission alignment
	•	ND-friendly signals (self-disclosed only)
	•	Industry fit

Layer 5 — Human Review

No outreach auto-triggered.

⸻

5. Engagement Philosophy

The system must never:
	•	Infer neurodivergence
	•	Exploit distress
	•	Target panic moments
	•	Over-optimize for capital concentration

The system must:
	•	Detect complexity before burnout
	•	Encourage stabilizing support
	•	Default to gentleness when stress signals spike
	•	Preserve founder autonomy

⸻

6. Safeguards Built Into Architecture

6.1 Stress Dampening

If:
	•	Pressure score > threshold
	•	Urgency language spike detected

Then:
	•	ESL reduces outreach intensity
	•	Suggest Soft Value Share instead of pitch

⸻

6.2 Outreach Cadence Limiter
	•	Max 1 direct outreach per company per 60 days
	•	No follow-up escalation without response

⸻

6.3 Bias Audit System

Monthly review:
	•	Funding skew
	•	Industry skew
	•	Stage skew
	•	Public visibility skew

System flags concentration >70% in one category.

⸻

6.4 Quiet Signal Amplification

Increase weight for:
	•	Single infra hire without funding
	•	Compliance mention without VC
	•	API launch without press

Prevents venture-only bias.

⸻

7. Updated Success Metrics

Not just:
	•	Conversion rate

Also:
	•	% of conversations described as “good timing”
	•	% of outreach categorized as soft vs hard
	•	Reduction in your manual sourcing time
	•	Founder feedback on tone and relevance
	•	Burnout avoidance (self-reported energy level)

⸻

8. Definition of “Good Outcome”

A good outcome is:
	•	Founder feels understood, not targeted
	•	Founder has autonomy to decline without pressure
	•	You maintain steady pipeline without hustle
	•	ND founders feel safe and respected

⸻

9. Non-Goals

SignalForge will NOT:
	•	Auto-email founders
	•	Scrape private data
	•	Classify cognitive traits
	•	Predict psychological states
	•	Trigger high-pressure sequences

⸻

10. System Flow (Revised)

Signal → TRS
Signals + Context → ESL
TRS × ESL × Alignment → Outreach Recommendation
Human review → Action

⸻

11. Ethical Positioning Statement

SignalForge exists to:

Support founders at moments of architectural inflection with clarity and care — not to exploit urgency or distress.

⸻

12. Strategic Advantage

This positions you as:
	•	A timing strategist
	•	An ethical technical advisor
	•	A neurodivergent-aware operator
	•	Not a lead scraper

This is defensible.

⸻

Now Let’s Zoom In: Engagement Suitability Layer (ESL)

We’ll design this as a mathematical + architectural component.

⸻

1️⃣ Purpose of ESL

ESL answers:

Is this a healthy moment to initiate contact, and if so, what tone is appropriate?

It modulates outreach intensity — not readiness detection.

⸻

2️⃣ ESL Dimensions

Instead of measuring need, it measures environmental intensity and founder state context.

Proposed dimensions:

A. Stress Volatility Index (SVI)

Measures sudden spikes in pressure signals.

Inputs:
	•	Urgency language events
	•	Regulatory deadlines
	•	Hiring panic spikes
	•	Funding announcement + immediate hiring burst

Logic:
High volatility → reduce outreach intensity.

⸻

B. Communication Stability Index (CSI)

Measures posting frequency consistency.

If:
	•	Sudden silence after major funding
	•	Long gap after intense hiring signals

Interpretation:
Possible overwhelm → default to soft engagement.

⸻

C. Sustained Pressure Index (SPI)

If pressure remains high for >60 days:
Flag possible burnout risk.

This suggests:
	•	Stabilizing framing
	•	Diagnostic-first approach

⸻

D. Cadence Guard

Tracks:
	•	Last outreach date
	•	Interaction history

Automatically reduces ESL to near-zero if within cooldown window.

⸻

3️⃣ ESL Output

ESL Score: 0.0 – 1.0

Multiplier applied to TRS.

But more importantly, ESL maps to engagement type:

ESL Range	Engagement Type
0.0–0.2	Observe Only
0.2–0.4	Soft Value Share
0.4–0.7	Low-Pressure Intro
0.7–0.9	Standard Outreach
0.9–1.0	Direct Strategic Outreach


⸻

4️⃣ Key Design Principle

ESL should more often reduce intensity than increase it.

It is a braking system, not an accelerator.

⸻

5️⃣ Critical Safeguard

Pressure should not increase ESL.

High pressure:
	•	May increase TRS
	•	Should decrease ESL

This prevents urgency exploitation.

⸻


ESL should be:
	•	Transparent
	•	Explainable
	•	Simple rules-based for v2
	•	Fully auditable

No black-box ML.
