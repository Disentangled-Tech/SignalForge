# Observe Only — No Outreach

## Internal Notes Template

Reason for observe-only:

- Cooldown active
- Stability volatility detected
- Low alignment
- Insufficient signal clarity

### Re-evaluation Trigger

Reconsider outreach if:

- StabilityModifier > 0.7
- New complexity signals appear
- 60+ days pass since last outreach
- Alignment updated
