🏗️ Milestone 1 — Core Pack Engine (CTO Pack Parity)

Goal:
Replace hardcoded domain logic with Pack Architecture while preserving current CTO behavior.

You are not adding new industries yet.
You are proving the engine abstraction works.

⸻

🎯 Exit Criteria
	•	fractional_cto_v1 pack produces identical results to current system
	•	No startup/founder logic remains in core
	•	Lead feed renders from projection table
	•	Outreach drafts generated from pack playbooks
	•	ESL enforced via pack policy
	•	All data pack-scoped in DB

⸻

🔨 Issues Included

Foundation
	1.	Update Database Schema to Support Signal Pack Architecture
	2.	Enforce Workspace + Pack Scoping Across All Data Access
	3.	Implement Signal Pack Loader with Manifest + Schema Validation
	4.	Implement Pack Validation CI + Lint + Ethical Policy Gates

⸻

Pipeline
	5.	Implement Event-Driven Pipeline with Idempotent Jobs
	6.	Implement Deriver Engine (Pack-Driven)
	7.	Refactor Scoring Engine to Pack Profiles
	8.	Implement Pack-Aware ESL Policy Engine

⸻

Projection + Explainability
	9.	Implement Lead Feed Projection + Incremental Updates
	10.	Implement Explainability Renderer

⸻

Outreach
	11.	Implement Structured Draft Input + Sanitization
	12.	Implement Playbook Loader + Draft Engine
	13.	Refactor Outreach Orchestrator (Pack-Driven)
	14.	Add Pack-Aware Safety & Critic Layer

⸻

CTO Extraction
	15.	Audit Startup/Fractional CTO Assumptions
	16.	Create pack_fractional_cto_v1
	17.	Remove Hardcoded Domain Logic from Core

⸻

UX
	18.	Refactor LeadCard UI to Use Taxonomy Labels
	19.	Replace Instability Flag with Sensitivity System

⸻

🚦Gate to Move On
	•	CTO pack fully operational
	•	Switching active pack does not crash system (even if only one pack exists)
	•	All scoring and outreach comes from pack config
	•	Regression tests pass

If this gate fails, stop and fix abstraction before adding bookkeeping.

⸻

📦 Milestone 2 — Bookkeeping Pack Beta

Goal:
Prove cross-industry portability with first non-tech pack.

⸻

🎯 Exit Criteria
	•	bookkeeping_v0 pack loads without schema change
	•	Lead surfacing behaves differently from CTO pack
	•	Distress signals suppressed correctly
	•	Outreach tone matches bookkeeping playbooks
	•	Beta feedback instrumentation working

⸻

🔨 Issues Included

Runtime
	1.	Implement Active Pack Selection per Workspace
	2.	Define Pack Switching Semantics (No Auto Reprocess)

⸻

Bookkeeping Pack
	3.	Create taxonomy.yaml for bookkeeping_v0
	4.	Create derivers.yaml
	5.	Create scoring.yaml
	6.	Create esl_policy.yaml
	7.	Create outreach playbooks

⸻

Validation
	8.	Run 50-Observation Simulation
	9.	Implement Beta Feedback Instrumentation

⸻

Alerts
	10.	Implement Pack-Scoped Signal Alert System

⸻

Governance
	11.	Implement Observation Retention + Redaction Controls

⸻

🚦Gate to Move On
	•	≥70% leads marked useful in beta test sample
	•	No distress signal leaks
	•	Outreach drafts approved by beta user
	•	Pack switching stable
	•	No performance regression

If signal quality is poor → iterate on pack config, not core engine.

⸻

🚀 Milestone 3 — Hardening & Scaling Prep

Goal:
Prepare for controlled expansion to 2–3 additional industries.

⸻

🎯 Exit Criteria
	•	Stable performance at 10k+ signals/workspace
	•	Lead feed loads <200ms
	•	No cross-tenant leakage
	•	Idempotent job pipeline stable
	•	Regex safety enforced
	•	LLM cost bounded

⸻

🔨 Issues Included
	1.	Performance profiling + indexing optimization
	2.	Add per-workspace derivation quotas
	3.	Add circuit breaker for runaway pack
	4.	Add audit logging for pack loading + switching
	5.	Load test lead_feed projection
	6.	Add signals_hash caching for outreach drafts
	7.	Add pack version upgrade workflow

⸻

🚦Gate to Open Multi-Industry Beta
	•	Stable under simulated load
	•	No cross-pack bleed
	•	Feedback loop producing actionable insights
	•	Core architecture not requiring schema changes for new pack

⸻

📊 Rough Timeline (Lean Build)

If focused:
	•	Milestone 1: 2–3 weeks
	•	Milestone 2: 1–2 weeks
	•	Milestone 3: 1–2 weeks hardening

Total: ~4–6 weeks to robust cross-industry beta.

⸻

🧠 Strategic Insight

Milestone 1 is the most dangerous phase.

If abstraction is weak:
	•	You’ll leak domain logic back into core.
	•	Bookkeeping will feel bolted on.
	•	Performance complexity doubles.

If Milestone 1 is clean:
	•	Adding future industries becomes 70% configuration work.
