## Variant A — Medium

Hi {founder_name},

When product velocity increases, teams often feel technical strain before it becomes obvious.

I work with founders to create short stabilization plans that reduce decision fatigue and clarify what needs attention — without overhauling everything.

If you're open to a 15-minute conversation, I’d be glad to explore whether that might be useful for you.

If not, completely fine — appreciate the work you're doing either way.

Best,  
{your_name}

## Variant B — Extended

Hi {founder_name},

As companies grow, technical systems often shift from “working” to “quietly fragile.”

I help founders identify that shift early and design focused stabilization plans — typically in short engagements that create clarity without adding noise.

If it feels relevant, I’d welcome a brief conversation to compare notes.

If now isn’t ideal, no pressure at all.
