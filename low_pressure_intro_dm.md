# Low-Pressure Intro — LinkedIn DM

## Variant A — Short

Hi {founder_name},

I work with founders during technical inflection points — usually when growth starts stretching systems in subtle ways.

If you’re ever open to a short compare-notes conversation, I’d be happy to connect.

No pressure — just offering.

## Variant B — Medium

Hi {founder_name},

I support founders as they scale product and delivery without letting technical complexity spiral.

Often it’s less about rebuilding and more about reducing decision load and clarifying next steps.

If you’d ever find it useful to compare notes for 15 minutes, I’d be glad to.

If not, totally fine — wishing you steady progress either way.
