## Summary

Migrates **fractional_cto_v1** to Pack v2 (Milestone M6 from Pack v2 contract plan). Sets `schema_version` to `"2"` in the pack manifest and adds a data migration to update `config_checksum`. Includes code-review follow-ups: Pack v2 contract doc, deployment note for core YAML, deriver pack-isolation test, and a fix note for the core derivers loader on the taxonomy branch.

Related to #285 (Pack v2 contract). Does not close it.

## Changes

| Area | Change |
|------|--------|
| **fractional_cto_v1** | `pack.json`: `schema_version` `"1"` → `"2"`. Taxonomy and derivers remain on disk (loader in this branch still requires them until core taxonomy branch is merged). |
| **Migration** | `20260232_update_config_checksum_fractional_cto_v2.py`: Updates `signal_packs.config_checksum` for fractional_cto_v1 so DB matches pack after manifest change. |
| **Daily aggregation** | Fixes: duplicate docstrings, broken return block, duplicate imports; unused import removed. |
| **Tests** | `test_daily_aggregation.py`: single docstring, consolidated imports. `test_deriver_engine.py`: new `test_deriver_output_instances_all_have_job_pack_id` (pack isolation); existing passthrough test asserts each instance has `pack_id == job pack_id`. |
| **Docs** | `docs/pack_v2_contract.md` (new): Pack v2 required/optional files and validation. `docs/DEPLOYMENT_CORE_REQUIREMENTS.md`: core taxonomy/derivers YAML required at deploy. `docs/REVIEW_FIX_CORE_DERIVERS_LOADER.md`: instructions for core derivers loader fix on feat/core-taxonomy-deriver-registry-285. |

## Verification

- `pytest tests/ -v -W error` (relevant subsets)
- `ruff check app/ tests/`
- Snyk clean on changed code

## Backward compatibility

- fractional_cto_v1 behavior unchanged at runtime (no code paths branch on schema_version in this branch). After core taxonomy branch merge, v2 optional taxonomy/derivers will apply.
- Pack scoping unchanged; deriver test enforces `SignalInstance.pack_id == job pack_id`.
