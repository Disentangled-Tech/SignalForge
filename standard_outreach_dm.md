# Standard Outreach — LinkedIn DM

## Variant A — Structured

Hi {founder_name},

I work with founders when product momentum increases and systems need a steadier structure underneath.

The goal isn’t rebuilding — it’s reducing chaos and giving you clearer decision leverage.

If you’d be open to a short 15-minute conversation, I’d be glad to explore whether that support would be helpful.

If not, completely understand — just wanted to reach out thoughtfully.
