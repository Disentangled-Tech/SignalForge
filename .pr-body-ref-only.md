## Summary

Core taxonomy and deriver follow-up: **incorporation** stays in core taxonomy but is removed from core derivers passthrough (ingest-only for company resolution; no SignalInstances from derive). Pack v2 optional taxonomy/derivers, schema validation against core signal_ids, and **derive uses core derivers only** (pack fallback removed). Docs and tests updated.

Related to #285 (does not close it).

## Changes

| Area | Change |
|------|--------|
| **Core derivers** | Remove `incorporation` from passthrough; update NOTE to state it is in core taxonomy but omitted from derivers (ingest-only). |
| **Core taxonomy** | Clarify incorporation comment: accepted at ingest, omitted from core derivers passthrough. |
| **Event types / normalize** | Prefer core taxonomy; legacy SIGNAL_EVENT_TYPES for backward compat (e.g. incorporation). Pack with no taxonomy uses core. |
| **Pack loader** | For `schema_version "2"`, taxonomy.yaml and derivers.yaml optional (M5). |
| **Pack schema** | v2: validate scoring/ESL/derivers against core signal_ids; empty derivers skip validation (M2). |
| **Deriver engine** | Core derivers only; pack deriver fallback removed (M6). Core load failure → job failed. |
| **Docs** | New `CORE_VS_PACK_RESPONSIBILITIES.md`; `deriver-engine.md` and `signal-models.md` updated for core-only derive. |
| **Tests** | Deriver: core-only behavior, v2 pack without derivers file, core load failure marks job failed; normalizer core/legacy and pack-no-taxonomy tests. |

## Verification

- `pytest tests/ -v -W error` (relevant subsets / full suite)
- `ruff check app/ tests/`
- Snyk clean on changed code

## Backward compatibility

- **fractional_cto_v1**: Unchanged (schema_version "1"; taxonomy and derivers required). Derive output unchanged (core derivers match prior pack passthrough).
- **incorporation**: Still accepted at ingest via core taxonomy + legacy event_types; no derive output (intended).
- **Pack scoping**: Unchanged; no cross-tenant impact.
