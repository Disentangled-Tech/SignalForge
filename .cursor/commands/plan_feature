Your task is to create a step-by-step implementation plan to Implement Lead Feed Projection + Incremental Updates.

Assume this is a live SaaS system with production users.
Prioritize backward compatibility and safe migrations over elegance.

The plan must:
	1.	Preserve all existing functionality (fractional CTO use case must continue to work exactly as before).
	2.	Extract all domain-specific logic into pack_fractional_cto_v1.
	3.	Introduce pack-scoped signals, scoring, ESL, and outreach.
	4.	Avoid breaking database migrations or requiring destructive schema changes.
	5.	Minimize large refactors in a single step — prefer staged refactors.

Structure your response as follows:

1. Current State Assessment
	•	Where domain logic currently lives
	•	Tight coupling areas
	•	High-risk refactor zones

2. Proposed Refactor Strategy
	•	Safe order of changes
	•	What to abstract first
	•	What to delay
	•	Temporary compatibility layers if needed

3. File-Level Change Plan

For each step:
	•	Files to modify
	•	New modules to create
	•	Interfaces to introduce
	•	Data migrations required

4. Regression Risk Analysis
	•	What could break
	•	How to detect breakage
	•	Tests required

5. Incremental Milestones
	•	Phase 1: Engine abstraction
	•	Phase 2: CTO pack extraction
	•	Phase 3: Pack activation runtime
	•	Phase 4: Cleanup

Do not write code yet.
Produce a clear implementation roadmap suitable for staged PRs.

Do not redesign unrelated systems.
Only modify what is necessary to support the Pack Architecture.
