## Variant A — Short

Hi {founder_name},

I help founders navigate technical inflection points — especially when product and team growth begin to outpace systems.

If it would be helpful, I’d be glad to compare notes for 15 minutes sometime.

If now isn’t ideal, completely understand.

Best,  
{your_name}

## Variant B — Medium

Hi {founder_name},

As teams grow, there’s often a quiet shift where technical decisions get heavier and coordination becomes harder.

I specialize in helping founders simplify that transition and reduce cognitive overhead.

If you’re open to it, I’d be glad to have a brief conversation and see if it’s useful.

If not, no worries at all.
