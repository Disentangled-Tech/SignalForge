## Variant A — Short

Hi {founder_name},

When teams start juggling more product + delivery at the same time, tech decisions that worked earlier can quietly get heavier.

I put together a short {value_asset} that helps founders spot those pressure points early.

Want me to send it over?

No worries at all if now isn’t the right time.

## Variant B — Medium

Hi {founder_name},

I work with founders who are scaling product while trying to keep their systems stable — and there’s usually a moment where complexity increases faster than expected.

I’ve found that a lightweight {value_asset} can reduce a lot of decision fatigue during that phase.

If it would be useful, I’m happy to send it your way.

Totally fine if now’s not the moment — just thought I’d offer.
